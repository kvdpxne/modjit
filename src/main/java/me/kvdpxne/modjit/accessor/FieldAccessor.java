/**
 * Defines the contract for accessing and manipulating field values through reflection.
 * <p>
 * This interface abstracts the underlying {@link java.lang.reflect.Field} object, providing a simplified API for
 * reading and writing field values while handling reflection complexities such as accessibility management, type
 * checking, and exception translation. Implementations manage field accessibility and convert reflection-specific
 * exceptions into the library's standardized exception hierarchy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The interface supports both instance fields (non-static) and static fields. For static field operations, the target
 * parameter can be {@code null}. All operations automatically handle accessibility concerns and restore the original
 * accessibility state after completion.
 * </p>
