/**
 * An implementation of {@link me.kvdpxne.modjit.accessor.FieldAccessor} that wraps a {@link java.lang.reflect.Field}
 * and provides the logic for getting and setting field values using reflection.
 * <p>
 * This class handles the complete field access process, including accessibility management, value retrieval and
 * assignment, exception translation, and state restoration. It ensures that the original accessibility state of the
 * field is preserved and restored after each access attempt, preventing security warnings and potential accessibility
 * leaks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The implementation immediately enables field accessibility upon instantiation and manages the accessibility lifecycle
 * through try-finally blocks to guarantee proper state restoration even when exceptions occur during field operations.
