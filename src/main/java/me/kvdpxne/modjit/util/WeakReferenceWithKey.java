/**
 * A {@link WeakReference} that holds an additional key object for identifying cached entries.
 * <p>
 * This class extends {@link WeakReference} to associate a strong reference to a key object with the weakly referenced
 * value. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a {@link java.util.WeakHashMap} cannot be used directly, such
 * as when a {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap} is required for caching. The key allows the cached entry to be
 * identified and removed when the value is garbage collected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation overrides {@link #equals(Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} to be based solely on the key, allowing
 * instances to be used as keys in maps or elements in sets where identity is determined by the associated key. This
 * enables efficient cache cleanup when the weakly referenced value is garbage collected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical usage involves using this class in conjunction with a {@link ReferenceQueue} to clean up cache entries when
 * their values are no longer strongly reachable.
