 * A {@link java.lang.ref.WeakReference} that holds an additional key object.

 * This class extends {@code WeakReference} to associate a strong reference to a key object with the weakly referenced
 * value. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a {@link java.util.WeakHashMap} cannot be used directly, such
 * as when a {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap} is required for the cache. The key allows the cached entry to be
 * identified and removed when the value is garbage collected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation also overrides {@link #equals(java.lang.Object)} and {@link #hashCode()} to be based solely on
 * the key, allowing instances to be used as keys in maps or elements in sets where identity is determined by the
 * associated key.
