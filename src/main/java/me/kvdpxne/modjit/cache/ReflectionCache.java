/**
 * An abstract base class for implementing reflection-based caches with weak references.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a thread-safe caching mechanism using {@link ConcurrentHashMap}
 * for storing weak references to cached values. It utilizes a {@link ReferenceQueue}
 * to track when cached values are garbage collected and automatically removes
 * the corresponding entries from the cache to prevent memory leaks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must implement the logic for computing the cached values by overriding
 * the {@link #getOrCompute(Object, Supplier)} method or using it as provided.
 * This base class handles the concurrency, weak referencing, and cleanup logic.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <K> the type of the cache key
 * @param <V> the type of the cached value
