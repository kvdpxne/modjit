/**
 * An abstract base class for implementing reflection-based caches with weak references.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a thread-safe caching mechanism using {@link ConcurrentHashMap} for storing weak references to
 * cached values. It utilizes a {@link ReferenceQueue} to track when cached values are garbage collected and
 * automatically removes the corresponding entries from the cache to prevent memory leaks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The cache employs a per-key locking mechanism to ensure that only one thread computes the value for a specific key
 * concurrently, preventing redundant computations while maintaining thread safety.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must implement the logic for computing the cached values by using the protected
 * {@link #getOrCompute(Object, Supplier)} method. This base class handles the concurrency, weak referencing, and
 * cleanup logic automatically.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The cache uses {@link WeakReferenceWithKey} to associate cache keys with weakly referenced values, enabling automatic
 * cleanup when values are garbage collected while maintaining the ability to identify which cache entry should be
 * removed.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <K> the type of the cache key; must implement proper {@code equals()} and {@code hashCode()} methods
 * @param <V> the type of the cached value
