/**
 * Represents a key for caching field accessors within the reflection library.
 * <p>
 * This class encapsulates the identifying attributes of a specific field: the fully qualified name of the declaring
 * class, the simple name of the field, the fully qualified name of its type (if specified), and its modifiers. It is
 * designed for use as a key in a map-based cache, providing consistent implementations of {@link #equals(Object)} and
 * {@link #hashCode()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The key considers all four components when determining equality and hash code, ensuring that fields with different
 * names, types, or modifiers are treated as distinct cache entries even when declared in the same class. This allows
 * for precise field lookup based on various combinations of search criteria.
 * </p>
